## Theorem 13

The pivot columns of a matrix $A$ form a basis for the column space of $A$.

## Proof of [@thm-2-8-13]

Suppose $B$ is the RREF of $A$, then there's a sequence of elementary matrices, $E_1,\dots,E_p$, where $E_p\cdots E_1 A=B$. Let $E=E_p\cdots E_1$, so we have $EA=B$.

Denote the columns of $A$ and $B$ as $\mathbf{a}_k$ and $\mathbf{b}_k$, respectively. The linear relationship in the columns of $A$ is preserved in the columns of $B$ because
\begin{align}
EA &= E\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{a}_1 & \cdots & \mathbf{a}_n\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}E\mathbf{a}_1 & \cdots & E\mathbf{a}_n\end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{b}_1 & \cdots & \mathbf{b}_n\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
Thus, if $\mathbf{a}_k = \sum_{j\neq k} c_j\mathbf{a}_j$, $\mathbf{b}_k=E\mathbf{a}_k=E\sum_{j\neq k} c_j \mathbf{a}_j=\sum_{j\neq k} c_j E\mathbf{a}_j=\sum_{j\neq k} c_j\mathbf{b}_j$.

Conversely, since $E$ is invertible, we can prove the linear relationship in the columns of $B$ is preserved in the columns of $A$ by replacing $E$ in the above proof with $E^{-1}$ and swapping $A$ and $B$.

Therefore, we have proved the linear relationship is the same in both $A$ and $B$.

::: {.remark}

It's easy to show that every non-pivot column can be written as a linear combination of the prior pivot columns by the definition of RREF, so we can safely remove the non-pivot columns from the set of the columns without changing the span. Thus, we have completely proved [@thm-2-8-13].

## Linear Transformation

::: {.remark}

Consider a linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, where $T(\mathbf{x})=A\mathbf{x}$. $\operatorname{Col}A$ is the range of the transformation, and $\operatorname{Nul}A$ is the set of $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ whose image under transformation $T$ is $\mathbf{0}$. Thus, for every $T(\mathbf{u})=\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{p}\in\operatorname{Nul}A$, $T(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{p})=\mathbf{v}$.
