# 3.2 [R] Number Theory? {.unnumbered}

::: {.remark}

Suppose we have a matrix $A$, two of whose rows are $\bf{u}$ and $\bf{v}$. How to construct a matrix $A'$ with the opposite determinant?

The simplest way is to negate either row. However, we can also replace $\bf{v}$ with $\bf{u} - \bf{v}$. In number theory, we have
$$-v \equiv u-v \pmod{u}$$

## Bézout's Identity

::: {.remark}

Bézout's identity states that for given $a$ and $b$, there exist $x$ and $y$ such that $ax+by = \gcd(a,b)$.

Consider the determinant of $\mat{m_1 & m_2 \\ x_1 & x_2}$.
$$\det\mat{m_1 & m_2 \\ x_1 & x_2} = m_1x_2 - m_2x_1$$
