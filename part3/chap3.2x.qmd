# 3.2 [R] Number Theory? {.unnumbered}

::: {.remark}

Suppose we have a matrix $A$, two of whose rows are $\bf{u}$ and $\bf{v}$. How to construct a matrix $A'$ with the opposite determinant?

The simplest way is to negate either row. However, we can also replace $\bf{v}$ with $\bf{u} - \bf{v}$. In number theory, we have
$$-v \equiv u-v \pmod{u}$$

## Bézout's Identity

::: {.remark}

Bézout's identity states that for given $a$ and $b$, there exist $x$ and $y$ such that $ax+by = \gcd(a,b)$.

Consider the determinant of $\mat{m_1 & m_2 \\ x_1 & x_2}$.
$$\det\mat{m_1 & m_2 \\ x_1 & x_2} = m_1x_2 - m_2x_1$$

If the determinant is $1$, which implies the bounded area by $\mat{m_1 & m_2}$ and $\mat{x_1 & x_2}$ is $1$, then $m_1$ and $m_2$ are coprime. Additionally,
$$m_1x_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{m_2}$$
$$-m_2x_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{m_1}$$

Thus, $x_2$ is the inverse of $m_1$ modulo $m_2$, and $-x_1$ is the inverse of $m_2$ modulo $m_1$.
